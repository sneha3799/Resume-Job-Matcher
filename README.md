# Resume-Job-Matcher

This system takes resume as input, fetch the skills from the reusume and suggest the relevant job postings to the candidate using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Model (LLM)
The system also has a feature of hybrid search in which first keyword search happens using BM25 ranking algorithm and then vector search happens aiming to discern the query's underlying context or meaning.
